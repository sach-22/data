# City Air Quality Data Extraction, Transformation and Loading
Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.  The Objective of this mini project is to collect major Indian cities air quality data, transform it and load it in the educational institute database for students use. I will analyse raw data and create ETL pipeline of major Indian Cities Air Quality data. I have taken raw dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) . The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India. Once data is transformed and loaded into the database than this historical data can be used for air quality studies by the students. As the loading database is belong to educational institute. 
The Dataset have 26 different cities and various stations air quality and AQI data. 

Dataset details:
Below 2 Datasets used from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-indiaa)
1.	city_hour.csv 
This Dataset is the citywise air quality data of 26 major Indian cities, which includes 25 different air quality parameters. 
2.	Station_hour.csv
This Dataset has air quality data of different stations from different cities in India.

Tools Used: 
1.	Pandas, Numpy
2.	pyodbc libraries 
3.	EDA Techniques
4.	MS SQL Server & Database 

Plan to Execute:
1.	Firstly I will extract raw data from available sources using Pandas library.
2.	I will transform this data in the required format so that one can do data analysis to reach to the final conclusion.
3.	I will then load this data to the dataset so that it can be used for Data analysis.
