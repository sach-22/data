Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.  The Objective of this mini project is to collect major Indian cities air quality data, transform it and load it in the educational institute database for students use. I will analyse raw data and create ETL pipeline of major Indian Cities Air Quality data. I have taken raw dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india) . The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India. Once data is transformed and loaded into the database than this historical data can be used for air quality studies by the students. As the loading database is belong to educational institute. 
The Dataset have 26 different cities and various stations air quality and AQI data.
